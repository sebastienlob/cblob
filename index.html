            <h2>My story:</h2>
            <p>     I have a great affinity for technology in general and programming in particular. I first enter this world through microcontrolers and SBC (such as Arduino and Raspberry pi)
             for personnal projects. This allowed me to develop skills sush as PCB soldering, 3D printing and electronic tinkering. I am a strong advocator of giving the control back to the end-user.
             On the professional side I used to work with PLC (mainly ABB) which lead me to work in this industry, it is still about programming but at the most basic level using wiring and relays. I have developped through my early carreer some strong mechanic skills
             and low voltage electric troubleshooting abilities.
            </p>

            <h2>3D printing</h2>
            <p>As I told you I am into 3D printing, you know to give the power back and all that... (Yes, I also like Rage Against The Machine). So here are few of my prints. Take whatever you want!</p>
            <h3>#1. Laptop support:</h3>
            <p>I have a 6 year old ROG laptop. They are tough, they have one of the best keyboard on a laptop and their performance at that time were top of the line (I hadn't have the opportunity
            to test the newer generations) but they were also heavy. like 7 pound heavy. So I designed a support to keep the beast stable on my desk. so here it is:</p>
