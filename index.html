            <p>My story:</p>
            <p>     I have a great affinity for technology in general and programming in particular. I first enter this world through microcontrolers and SBC (such as Arduino and Raspberry pi)
             for personnal projects. This allowed me to develop skills sush as PCB soldering, 3D printing and electronic tinkering. I am a strong advocator of giving the control back to the end-user.
             On the professional side I used to work with PLC (mainly ABB) which lead me to work in this industry. I have developped through my early carreer some strong mechanic skills
             and low voltage electric troubleshooting.
