    <h3>#1. Laptop support:</h3>
        <p>I have a 6-year-old ROG laptop. They are tough, they have one of the best keyboard on a laptop and their performance at that time were top of the line (I hadn't have the opportunity
        to test the newer generations) but they were also heavy. like 7 pound heavy. So I designed a support to keep the beast stable on my desk. so here it is <a href="" download="https://github.com/sebastienlob/cblob/blob/master/.stl%20files/support%20laptop%20v13.stl">(stl file)</a> :</p>
