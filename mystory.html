    <article id='who'>
        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p class='story'>I have a great affinity for technology in general and programming in particular. I first enter this world through microcontrolers and SBC (such as Arduino and Raspberry pi)
        for personnal projects. This allowed me to develop skills sush as PCB soldering, 3D printing and electronic tinkering. I am a strong advocator of giving the control back to the end-user.
        On the professional side I used to work with PLC (mainly ABB) which lead me to work in this industry, it is still about programming but at the most basic level using wiring and relays. I have developped through my early carreer some strong mechanic skills
        and low voltage electric troubleshooting abilities.</p>

        <h2>3D printing</h2>
        <p class='story'>I love 3D printing! So 2 years ago I bought the Prusa Mk3 printer after a long period of reading reviews and watching youtube videos.
            and I don't regret my decision. I barely ever change the preselected settings and it delivers the same high quality prints as day one.
            The process of assembling it is fun and the community around it is very supportive. And the cherry on top, The project is also completely open-source.</p>

        <h2>electronics</h2>
        <p class='story'>I have always been fascinating by how things work and it naturally lead me to tinker with everything I could put my hands on. Thanks to Arduino boards becoming more popular it became easy to
            work on project at home and learn how to use sensors and actuators and have fun building things.</p>

        <h2>programming</h2>
        <p class='story'>I learn the basics of programming at school and I have been hooked ever since. I first started with Microcontrolers who used C or a derivative then when I advanced in my curiculum
            I worked with Programmable Logic Controlers. Now I enter the world of Javascript and its endless possibilities.</p>
